# This repository is now deprecated as TON now publishes full node source in [ton-blockchain/ton](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton) repo. For compiled binaries go to [poma/ton](https://github.com/poma/ton)

# Telegram Open Network lite client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/poma/ton-lite-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/poma/ton-lite-client) [![Docker Cloud Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/poma/ton-lite-client.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/poma/ton-lite-client/builds)

This is a full unchanged TON lite node source from https://test.ton.org/download (except for added Dockerfile, .travis-ci.yml and README.md). This is a perfect starting point if you want to fork TON client and add custom features. Our bot checks upstream for updates every 5 min and commits any changes.

Also we have configured a public CI server (Travis) that builds ton client binaries for Mac, Linux, (Windows is coming soon), and a Docker container. 

## Download
